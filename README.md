# Advanced-Firewall-Lab-Trilayer

# 🔐 Advanced Firewall Lab

A layered firewall laboratory demonstrating **defense-in-depth** using
**iptables**, **pfSense**, and **Python (Scapy)** in a controlled environment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase how firewall controls operate at
different layers of a network by integrating multiple open-source technologies.

The lab combines:

- **iptables** for host-based firewalling and traffic filtering on Linux
- **pfSense** for network perimeter firewalling, routing, and policy enforcement
- **Python (Scapy)** for packet inspection, traffic generation, and rule validation

Together, these components simulate a real-world enterprise firewall
architecture commonly used in SOC and Blue Team environments.
